# Sample Agent using Jabir 400B

Have you ever wondered how ChatGPT is capable of making images? Well this is how it does. OpenAI's engineers and programmers have access to API's for Dall-E, so they had to connect them to ChatGPT. In this particular notebook, I tried my best to make a very simple AI agent using [Jabir Project's 400B LLM](https://jabirproject.org). 

As you can see, there is no framework involved here and everything has been done in pure python (apparently even the worst way possible). The goal was to showcase how easy it is to add _action_ to a large language model.
